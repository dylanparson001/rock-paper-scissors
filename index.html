<!--
    Copy your original code into a new file so you don’t lose it.
    For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
    Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that calls your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
    Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
    Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
    You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of the programmer’s life.
    Don’t forget to go back and add your new version to the original Rock Paper Scissors Project!
